# Official network and token artwork

Retrieved 2026-09-15. No recoloring, cropping, tracing, outlines or logo shadows; rendering uses `object-fit: contain`. The SVGs are stored exactly as supplied. `pyusd.png` is the supplied raster resampled to display size and nothing else — see its entry below. Surrounding cards are ChainPay artwork. These marks describe network/token compatibility on Devnet, not endorsement or PayPal checkout support.

- `solana.svg`: https://solana.com/src/img/branding/solanaLogoMark.svg — linked by https://solana.com/branding . Preserve clearspace and original gradient.
- `usdc.svg`: `Token Logo/USDC Token.svg` from https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/Pressroom/brandkit/logo-downloads/usdc.zip — linked by https://www.circle.com/pressroom . Token mark displayed at least 32px high with clearspace.
- `pyusd.png`: https://mintcdn.com/paxos-0ac97319/Vwn6v0Q_snwFVgjM/images/pyusd_logo.png — embedded by issuer documentation https://docs.paxos.com/guides/stablecoin/pyusd .
  The supplied file is 513x512, 16-bit RGBA, 35.7 kB. It is displayed at 36px and
  44px (`.asset-mark` in landing.css), so shipping 513px at 16-bit sent roughly
  35 kB to draw a 44px mark. Stored here resampled to 176x175 (4x the largest
  display size, covering 3x-density screens with headroom) at 8-bit RGBA, 13.4 kB.
  Alpha is preserved. That is a resample only — the same operation the browser was
  performing at render time, done once at build time instead. No recolor, no crop,
  no trace. Re-fetch the URL above for the untouched original.

## Official wallet artwork · 2026-09-15

Unmodified vendor SVG originals, used to identify wallet choices and official download links. Discovery artwork does not establish that the wallet is installed, supports ChainPay's Devnet signing flow, or endorses ChainPay. Connected wallet rows should prefer the icon supplied by Wallet Standard. Preserve original colors and proportions.
